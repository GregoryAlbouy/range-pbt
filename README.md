# range-pbt

Write a function `rangeN`, that, given a natural number `n`, creates the range of natural numbers from `1` to `n`, e.g.:

```elm
rangeN 5 -- [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
```

## Development

### Install dependencies

It is **not** required to have your own version of Elm.
Installing npm deps is enough:

```sh
npm i
```

### Package scripts

- Run test suite
  ```sh
  npm run test
  ```
- Watch test suite
  ```sh
  npm run test:watch
  ```
- Run any Elm command
  ```
  npx elm <command>
  # npx elm install abc/def
  # npx elm repl
  ```
